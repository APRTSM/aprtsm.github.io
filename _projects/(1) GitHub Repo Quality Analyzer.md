# GitHub Repo Quality Analyzer

In this project, our objective is to create a tool that automatically performs prefined analysis on GitHub in order to calculate a quality score for a given repository.
Concretely, we target building a GitHub app that analyzes the contributions of users and uses quality indicators in these contributions to provide a score about the repository's quality and each user's impact on this score.
