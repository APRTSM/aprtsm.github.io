Here you can find out how to get involved in APR-TSM research and what the experience is like. It’s intended for undergraduate and Masters students. Ph.D. applicants please read my Student FAQ instead.

My research group works on automated program repair and tools for software maintainance. I am especially enthusiastic about getting students into research. 

## About the HCI Research Group

Our research group works on "". What this means, is . We have expertise in this area of research, and I think it's a promising approach that produces novel ideas. At the end of the day, what we’re trying to do is investigate ideas that have never been tried before.

There are many ideas I am excited about, and might completely transform a domain. You can see from our group website (which is the best place to learn about actual ongoing research) that we work on many projects simultaneously. I also believe in long-term focus, so all 12 projects are active and expected to continue indefinitely, and we are cautious about starting new projects. The projects are each assigned to small teams, usually led by a graduate student or myself, plus an undergraduate or Masters student.

Our research has two goals: releasing something people will use, and publishing academic papers. We do research and write them up as papers, to submit for publication at computer science conferences. Nearly all of our papers have undergraduate student co-authors. So undergraduate students are critical to our research. But besides papers, we also care about impact -- another equally important goal is deploying our systems widely as a self-serve product, so that people elsewhere find and use them without us.

## Expectations

Student researchers like you are essential to the research, and you should know what you are getting into beforehand. Joining our research group means you will learn to do research, while doing research at the same time. At the end of two semesters, you should be capable as an independent researcher. This means you should be able to investigate your own ideas in a research-oriented way if you desired. You should be able to ask good questions about others’ work and contribute ideas.

You can expect to do research for 10-15 hours a week, and you should be able to work independently and with your team, while knowing when to reach out. It's ideal to do research in a semester when you're not overcommitted, so you can focus on doing your best work. If you are taking 2 time-consuming courses, applying and flying out for internships, serving as a TA, and other extracurriculars, then you won't be getting much out of research because research is a non-linear task and tempting to postpone when more urgent tasks are at hand. On the other hand, research can easily consume all remaining time you have, but you’ll get what you put in.

Research projects take a while to do, usually 30 months on average to reach a major milestone like a publication. If you have one semester to do research, you might be able to contribute something, but it's unlikely you will make enough progress to co-author a paper due to the ramp-up time. If you're involved for 2 semesters, or 1 semester + summer, then there is a good chance for you to be a co-author later on (publication is never guaranteed since our paper submissions are reviewed by external committees).


## Preparation

It's good to start thinking about research early. While we've had students from all years in our research group, I've found that students in their 3rd or 4th undergraduate years or Masters students are in the best position to contribute. That doesn’t mean we don’t take first or second year undergraduate students, but that you will be held to the same standards as upper-level students in terms of time commitment and bringing a relevant skill to the table (see Joining section below). The Fall semester is a tricky one, where interviewing for internships or jobs may take a lot of time, so Spring may sometimes be a better semester to get started if you feel like you are already committed to a lot in the Fall.

One great way to understand what we’re doing is to use the research. All twelve of our projects are released online as products you can try (Sochiatrist is the only one where you need to email us to get the link for it, but that should change soon). It’s way more interesting to do research on something that you use yourself. And some students became research assistants later after we discovered they were submitting fixes or changes to our projects already. I recommend that you spend a bit of time trying out the products that you’re most interested in.


I'm usually available to chat about research! You can schedule an ad-hoc meeting with me by sending an email with your availability, or walk into my office hours (hours posted on my website when available). Another option is to drop by one of our research group meetings, where we usually have students presenting some of their ideas or work. Let me know in advance if you’d like to come.

You can reach out to me or one of my Ph.D. students before the start of the semester that you want to do research. Once the semester is underway, it's often too late. It's also common to start a conversation about research the semester or summer before, so I have a sense of what project you might be able to join.

## Joining

Each semester, we take in a couple of new undergraduate students and have around 15 people across all our projects. We don’t yet have generic research positions, or ways for students to try it a bit without making a commitment. Instead, we look for specific skills that can be fit into a particular research project and for someone who wants to do it long-term. Basically, we're looking for what you can bring to the table, while finding something you are enthusiastic about doing and have your own ideas. If you have a particular skill, then I can help match you to a project that would benefit from it. You only need one "superpower". Here are some skills that we are often seeking and an example of what we are looking for:

Mobile app development (have you developed+launched an Android or iOS app before?)
Computer vision (how would you extract the shape of a person's pupils from a headshot?)
Health (have you done clinical work in sleep or mental health?)
Phone systems (can you intercept Snapchat messages on your laptop or can send/receive commands from a phone?)
User studies (have you designed, run, and analyzed a user study for a research paper?)
Web development (have you developed a complex interactive web application before?)
Machine learning (have you developed non-classification/regression techniques like graphical models or causal inference or made predictions with time-series data?)
Graphics (can you render a 3D model of a room that you scan using a camera?)

To apply, it’s easiest to use our online form. Afterwards, we will reach out when we find a match for you. Sometimes it takes a while for us to find a fit for you, but do know that every application is reviewed by at least myself, and usually other project leads (Ph.D. students). Every application is usually looked at within a week, but we don’t make a decision right away. Once a semester we figure out what roles we are looking for, and we try to align our hiring with the TA hiring schedule. Often there is a period of consideration and discussion with the project leads. A resume is not necessary (in fact, a website can often be better since it’s in the format you choose), but we really just want to know what you think you can contribute and what you are passionate about! The best applications make it clear how your skills would contribute to the projects you’re most interested in, and describe past experiences that are most similar to the research projects.

Once we reach out, usually, you'll talk to the project lead who will get a sense of how you fit into the project, and then sometimes I’ll chat with you a bit as well. If you and we all agree that this is a match, then we can get started at the beginning of the next upcoming semester.

## Your First Week

In your first week, you'll meet the rest of the research group, and kick things off. We'll meet together for the first time, usually with your project lead. You'll also go through a bootcamp for getting into research. It's playfully called "everything you need to know", and originally started as some email tips. It will take about a week to go through, as there is a lot to digest. It should help you figure out what type of research you are doing, how it's situated among other research, how to read and write and present research, designing a user study, and how to evaluate research, as well as other tips. I encourage you to start a lab notebook to track your progress and ideas.

Your other task is to make a schedule and plan for the semester with your project lead, one that is totally flexible and can change later. Don't worry if there is uncertainty in your plan; this is normal -- if you know exactly how to do it before you start, it's probably not a good research project anyways. Include your thoughts about what may happen, what can go wrong, and what you expect to be major milestones. An example would be just Sections 1, 5, and 6 in this example.

Once this is all done, you should send me (Jeff) your schedule/plan, notes written in LaTeX of what you learned from parts 1 through 7 in "everything you need to know", and ask for an override code for CSCI 1970 in the HCI section. On the current course registration system, you need to ensure that the independent study checkbox is enabled to find this course. CSCI 1970 counts as 1000-level computer science credit and can be used as a capstone. Masters students enroll in CSCI 2980 instead of 1970, but otherwise everything else is the same.

## During the Semester or Summer

During the semester, you will be doing the research you planned, while meeting with your project lead once or twice a week. For some project teams, I'll join the weekly meetings, while for others, your project lead will arrange all the meetings. Near the end of the semester, we will typically meet and discuss next steps. In total, you will probably have a few meetings with me throughout the semester, plus at least weekly meetings with your project lead, but feel free to reach out if you want to talk about anything specific.

Communicating your research is almost as important as doing the research itself. You'll be attending bi-weekly research group meetings, where students in the group will be presenting their work for 10-20 minutes. It's fine to present new ideas, or challenges you want help with, or results. Everyone in the group should present once in the semester, including you! I’d also encourage you to reach out to another faculty member (in computer science or elsewhere) or a Ph.D. student outside our research group to get their feedback about your work. This gives you a chance to explain your work to someone who isn't familiar with it, and get an outside opinion.

The other way you’ll communicate is through weekly updates (think of it as a journal). The way you do this is up to you, and for example, can be a Google Doc that you keep appending to, or detailed git commit messages if you are pushing code frequently, or powerpoint slides that you add bullet points to. The file/messages should be shared to your project lead and me, and should be consistent over the semester.

The problems you're trying to solve in research have often never been done before. There's usually no StackOverflow question about it, no one in the group knows exactly how to do it yet. Sometimes the problem itself is underspecified, and we need to articulate the problem differently before you can make progress. So if you’re confused about something, stuck and need help, want to know if you’re on the right track, feel frustrated, think there is a better way to do something, etc. then please reach out to your project lead or me right away so we can steer you on to a better direction.

The other thing to consider is unlike homework assignments, your work will most likely need to be picked up by another person after you. If your thinking and decisions are not clearly documented, and your files/code are not clearly organized, it’ll be harder to continue and the next person will probably start over instead.

When you do research for course credit (your first semester, typically), you will get a grade at the end. To receive an A, you will have completed your first week tasks (the plan/schedule and the notes), presented your work at the group meeting mentioned above, and have prepared 13-15 weekly updates (note that there’s 14.5 weeks in a semester). To get a B, you will have done the first week tasks, presented at the group meeting, and prepared 10-12 weekly updates. Meeting with another faculty member to discuss the research can substitute for one of the weekly updates.

As part of the research group, you’ll also be helping out other people in the group, sometimes by piloting their user studies, or being a resource for technical skills or mentorship. When visitors come, you may be demoing or presenting to them.

Even after you're gone (when you graduate) if the project is still ongoing, if you made a substantial contribution to the work written in an upcoming paper, you will be listed as a co-author. If a paper is submitted with your name on it, remind me to give you a limited edition Brown HCI mug! Some undergraduate and Masters students publish papers that they are the primary author, because they do the majority of the work for that paper. And hopefully take with you the skills to conduct research on your own after Brown.

## What you’ll get out of it

It’s hard for me to say what you’ll get out of doing research afterwards since it’s a different experience for everyone, but here are a few things that I got out of my undergraduate research experience as a student:
The chance to work on something I thought would affect people around the world if successful, and do it long term and deeply, seeing it all the way through to end up presenting the work at a conference. At that point, I knew more about that tiny research space than anyone in the world.
Making a permanent mark on the field of computer science. Papers published with my name on it have outlasted any line of code in a product and are still cited today (influencing current research), and people reach out to me about my papers ever since my first publication.
The people I worked with in research have become friends and mentors that I see frequently, especially those who remain in academia. I got a chance to work closely with professors and received engaging feedback about my work (even if paper reviews can be harsh).

And of course, having research experience is what makes it possible to apply for graduate school later. But you might want something else out of research, which is totally fine. Let us know what it is when you apply, so we can tailor your research experience a bit for you.


You’ve made it through to the end! I hope this gives a transparent view of getting involved in HCI research, minus the actual research. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
