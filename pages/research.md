<!-- ### **Research**
My research interests lie in the general area of software engineering, with particular emphasis on automated program repair. My work draws on data mining, program analysis, and fault localization and aims to improve the automated program repair agenda towards boosting its adaption by practitioners.


#### Research Interests:
* Automated Program Repair
* Automated Fault Localization
* Fix Pattern Mining
* Mining Software Repositories
* Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Software Engineering
* Empirical Software Engineering.
